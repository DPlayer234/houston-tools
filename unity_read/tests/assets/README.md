Notes on the data here.

## abeikelongbi.*.bin

Excluded from the project licensing. Used for image decoding testing. The paths and dimensions are hard-coded into the test `texture2d_decode`.

Texture data for the chibi of the character Abercrombie. The ETC2_RGBA8 file is the decompressed data as found in the game files of Azur Lane, while RGBA32 is the final decoded data.

No, there's no specific reason for this choice. It just happened to be alphabetically the first one when I copied it and had the right format.
