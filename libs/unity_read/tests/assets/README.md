Notes on the data here.

## abeikelongbi & abeikelongbi.*.bin

Excluded from the project licensing. Used for image decoding testing. The paths and dimensions are hard-coded into the test `unpack_unityfs`.

Texture data for the chibi of the character Abercrombie. The ETC2_RGBA8 file is the decompressed data as found in the game files of Azur Lane, while RGBA32 is the final decoded data. The extensionless file is a UnityFS bundle storing the ETC2_RGBA8 texture data.

No, there's no specific reason for this choice. It just happened to be alphabetically the first one when I copied it and had the right format.
